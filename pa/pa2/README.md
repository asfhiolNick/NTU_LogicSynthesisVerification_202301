# LSV-PA, Fall 2023
This is a repository to host programming assignments of the course **Logic Synthesis and Verification** at National Taiwan University.
It is forked from the repository [ABC](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc) of UC Berkeley.

## Submission Workflow
We will follow a common [git feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) for submission.
All enrolled students will have their own branches named by their students' ID numbers.
You are asked to **fork** this repository and develop your program on the forked repository.
After finishing your programming assignments, the assignments **must** be submitted via a pull request to a student's **own branch** (please do not modify the master branch).
If you cannot find your own branch, please contact the TA.
If you don't know how to create a pull request, please read through this [document](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

### To avoid plagiarism ...
Please note that your fork of this public repository will also be public,
which means that if you push your code to the fork, it is visible to everyone.
In case you want to prevent other students from copying your solution,
an easy way is to push and create a pull request **at the last moment before the deadline**.

Another complicated way is to create a private repository to develop your solutions,
pull your code to the public fork after an assignment is finished,
and create a pull request via the public fork.
The benefit of this method is that you can push your code during the development and keep it private.
The drawback is again you need to create a pull request close to the deadline, as PRs are visible to everyone.
The detailed steps are documented [here](./private-fork.md).

For questions, you are encouraged to open an [issue](https://github.com/NTU-ALComLab/LSV-PA/issues).
As other students might have the same questions, discussing in an issue will benefit everyone.
Note that you can set labels, e.g., `PA0`, `PA1`, etc, to classify your questions.
